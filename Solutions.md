38. (A) Count the number of unique last names in people.csv.
 

39. (A) Did you accidentally count the CSV header in the previous challenge?
Ermmâ€¦yes

47. (A) Transform people.csv from ',' delimited to '|' delimited and save the result in people_pipe.csv.

48. (A) Find all of the files in "bunch_of_files/" that are duplicates of "file001.rand".

49. (A) Execute this challenge in exactly 2 steps

    1) (B) Create an empty file named "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.txt".
    2) (A) Remove "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.txt". Your command may
